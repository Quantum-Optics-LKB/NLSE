## CPU
The CPU kernel in the `NLSE` package is responsible for solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation using CPU resources. It utilizes the computational power of the central processing unit (CPU) to perform the necessary calculations.

To use the CPU kernel, you can call the appropriate functions or methods provided by the `NLSE` package. These functions will internally invoke the CPU-specific implementation to solve the NLSE.

The CPU kernel is suitable for small to medium-sized problems or when GPU resources are not available. It provides a reliable and efficient solution for solving the NLSE on CPU-based systems.

If you have specific code or implementation details related to the CPU kernel that you would like assistance with, please provide more information and I'll be happy to help.
