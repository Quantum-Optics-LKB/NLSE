# Welcome to NLSE

`NLSE` is a Python package for solving the nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLSE) in one and two dimensions.
The NLSE is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of a complex-valued wave function in a nonlinear medium.
The NLSE is a fundamental equation in the study of nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and other physical systems.

This package provides utility to easily simulate all sorts of non linear Schrödinger equations. It uses a [split-step spectral scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-step_method) to solve the equations.
