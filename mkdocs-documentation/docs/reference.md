`NLSE` is a Python package for solving the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation (NLSE) in one and two dimensions. The NLSE is a partial differential equation that describes the evolution of a complex-valued wave function in a nonlinear medium. The NLSE is a fundamental equation in the study of nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, and other physical systems.
